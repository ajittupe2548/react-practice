/*
2. Always Be Ready to Render
- Avoid Timing Assumptions: Ensure your component can re-render anytime without relying on specific timing or events.

- Legacy Methods Caution: Avoid methods like componentWillReceiveProps that reset state based on props, as they can cause issues with frequent parent re-renders.

- Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components:
    - Use fully controlled components to manage state through props.
Use uncontrolled components with a key to manage local state and reset when needed.
    - Donâ€™t Sync Props and State: Treat "receiving props" as just another render. Manage state either fully through props or locally.
