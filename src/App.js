// React and Web Components are built to solve different problems. Web Components provide strong encapsulation for reusable components, while React provides a declarative library that keeps the DOM in sync with your data. The two goals are complementary. As a developer, you are free to use React in your Web Components, or to use Web Components in React, or both.
// Most people who use React donâ€™t use Web Components, but you may want to, especially if you are using third-party UI components that are written using Web Components.
