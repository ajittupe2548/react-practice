What is SPA (Single Page Application)?
It is a web application or website that functions on a single web page by dynamically updating the content on the page instead of loading entire new pages from the server. In traditional web applications, clicking on a link or submitting a form would typically result in the browser requesting a new page from the server. However, in SPAs, the initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are loaded once, and subsequent interactions or data updates are handled asynchronously through APIs or AJAX calls.


What is difference between Client Side Routing and Server Side Routing?
- Client-Side Routing:
1) Routing logic and navigation handled on the user's web browser.
2) JavaScript frameworks like React Router or Angular Router used.
3) Clicking links updates content and URL without server requests.
4) Faster subsequent page loads, server mainly provides data and APIs.
- Server-Side Routing:
1) Routing logic and navigation handled by the web server.
2) Each user action requires a new request to the server.
3) Full page reloads for navigation.
4) Slower initial load times, server generates and serves HTML pages.
